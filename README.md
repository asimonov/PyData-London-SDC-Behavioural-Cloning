# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Part of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree [![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and 
convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. 
You will train, validate and test a model using Keras. 
The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

In the [simulator (download Version 2)](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) 
you can steer a car around a track for data collection. 
You'll use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then 
use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report


The Simulator
---

* Steering is controlled via position mouse instead of keyboard. This creates better angles for training. Note the angle is based on the mouse distance. To steer hold the left mouse button and move left or right. To reset the angle to 0 simply lift your finger off the left mouse button.
* You can toggle record by pressing R, previously you had to click the record button (you can still do that).
* When recording is finished, saves all the captured images to disk at the same time instead of trying to save them while the car is still driving periodically. You can see a save status and play back of the captured data.
* You can takeover in autonomous mode. While W or S are held down you can control the car the same way you would in training mode. This can be helpful for debugging. As soon as W or S are let go autonomous takes over again.
* Pressing the spacebar in training mode toggles on and off cruise control (effectively presses W for you).
* Added a Control screen
* Track 2 was replaced from a mountain theme to Jungle with free assets , Note the track is challenging
* You can use brake input in drive.py by issuing negative throttle values






### Dependencies

We use python 3.5 and [conda environment/package manager](http://conda.pydata.org/docs)

Using Anaconda consists of the following:

1. Install [`miniconda`](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or full Anaconda on your computer
2. Create a new `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html)
3. Each time you wish to work, activate your `conda` environment

---

## Installation

**Download** the version of `miniconda` that matches your system. Make sure you download the version for Python 3.5.

**NOTE**: There have been reports of issues creating an environment using miniconda `v4.3.13`. If it gives you issues try versions `4.3.11` or `4.2.12` from [here](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/).

[lin32]: https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

- **Linux:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#linux-miniconda-install
- **Mac:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install
- **Windows:** http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#windows-miniconda-install

**Create** your the `pydata-sdc` conda environment. 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml python=3.5
```

**Verify** that the carnd-term1 environment was created in your environments:

```sh
conda info --envs
```

**Cleanup** downloaded libraries (remove tarballs, zip files, etc):

```sh
conda clean -tp
```

### Uninstalling 

To uninstall the environment:

```sh
conda env remove -n pydata-sdc
```

---

## Using Anaconda

Now that you have created an environment, in order to use it, you will need to activate the environment. This must be done **each** time you begin a new working session i.e. open a new terminal window. 

**Activate** the `pydata-sdc` environment:

### OS X and Linux
```sh
$ source activate pydata-sdc
```
### Windows
Depending on shell either:
```sh
$ source activate pydata-sdc
```
or

```sh
$ activate pydata-sdc
```

Install tensorflow.

```sh
$ pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0
```

or, if you dont have an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA drivers: 

```sh
$ pip install tensorflow==1.0.0
```




## Resources

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. In the classroom, we have also provided sample data that you can optionally use to help train your model.

## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

...
```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).
